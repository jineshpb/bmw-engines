  "summary": "The BMW OHV V8 engine, produced from 1954 to 1965, is notable for being the only overhead valve V8 engine made by BMW, as all other BMW V8 engines feature a dual overhead camshaft design. It has a 90° V8 configuration with two displacement options: 2.6 L and 3.2 L. The engine features an aluminum cylinder block and head, uses petrol as fuel, and was succeeded by the BMW M60 engine. In 1965, the six-cylinder BMW M30 engine effectively replaced it at the top of BMW's engine lineup.",
