  "summary": "The BMW B48 is a turbocharged inline-four petrol engine that has been in production since 2014, succeeding the BMW N20. It was first implemented in the F56 Mini Hatch and has been utilized in various BMW models since 2015. The engine features a displacement of either 1,597 cc or 1,998 cc, with an aluminum construction for both the cylinder block and head. It employs a dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) valvetrain with variable valve timing and lift, and it utilizes a single twin-scroll turbocharger with an air-to-liquid intercooler. The engine delivers power outputs ranging from 115 to 225 kW (154 to 302 hp) and torque outputs from 250 to 450 N⋅m (184 to 332 lb⋅ft). The B48 engine is known for its advanced fuel injection system, utilizing high-pressure gasoline direct injection.",
