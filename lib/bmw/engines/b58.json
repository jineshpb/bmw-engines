  "summary": "The B58 engine is a 3.0L straight-six engine from BMW's modular engine family, recognized for its performance, having been named to Ward's World's 10 Best Engines four times between 2016 and 2020. It features a single twin-scroll turbocharger, DOHC with Valvetronic, and generates power outputs ranging from 322 to 382 hp and torque between 332 to 369 lb-ft. \n\nThe S58, introduced in 2019 as the high-performance variant of the B58, is also a 3.0L straight-six engine but utilizes a twin-turbo setup. It delivers higher performance, with power outputs between 453 and 560 hp and torque from 406 to 479 lb-ft. Both engines are made from closed-deck aluminum and utilize direct injection fuel systems.",
