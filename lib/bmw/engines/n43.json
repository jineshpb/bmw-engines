  "summary": "The BMW N43 engine, produced from 2007 to 2011, is an inline-4 engine available in 1.6 L and 2.0 L configurations. It features direct injection and was a part of BMW's transition to turbocharging, ultimately being replaced by the N13 engine in 2011. The N43 had several issues, including cam chain plastic guide breakage that led to oil starvation, and problems with injectors, coil packs, and the NOx sensor. It succeeded the N46/N45 engines.",
