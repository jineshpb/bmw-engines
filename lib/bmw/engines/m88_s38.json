  "summary": "The BMW M88 is a straight-6 DOHC petrol engine produced between 1978 and 1989, derived from the M49 engine used in BMW 3.0CSi racing cars. It was designed for higher performance compared to the BMW M30 engine. In North America, the M88 was replaced by the S38 engine until 1989, when the updated S38 became the global successor to the M88. The engine has a displacement of 3.5 L, with a cast iron block and aluminum head. The M30B35LE, a SOHC engine based on the M88/1, is also referred to as the M90.",
