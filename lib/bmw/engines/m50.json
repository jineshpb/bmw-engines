  "summary": "The BMW M50 engine, produced from 1990 to 1996, featured a straight-six configuration with displacements ranging from 1,991 cc to 2,494 cc. It was notable for being BMW's first engine to utilize variable valve timing (single VANOS), specifically in its upgraded M50TÜ version. The M50 engine began to be phased out in favor of the M52 engine introduced in 1994. The E36 M3 utilized the high-output S50 engine series, which was developed from the M50. The S50 engine was produced from 1992 to 2000 and also featured a straight-six layout, with displacements of 2,990 cc and 3,201 cc. Both engines used a combination of cast iron for the block and aluminum for the cylinder head, and they operated on petrol fuel.",
