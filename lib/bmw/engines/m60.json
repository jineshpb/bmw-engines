It features a 90° V8 configuration with two displacement options: 3.0 L and 4.0 L, constructed from aluminum for both the cylinder block and head. The M60 utilizes a DOHC valvetrain driven by a chain and runs on petrol. It was succeeded by the BMW M62 engine. An Alpina version of the M60 engine was also produced, offering larger displacements of 4.0 L and 4.6 L.",
