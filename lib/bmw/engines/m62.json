  "summary": "The BMW M62 engine, produced from 1995 to 2005, is a 90° V8 available in various displacements ranging from 3.5 L to 4.8 L. It features an aluminum cylinder block and head, DOHC valvetrain with variable valve timing (VVT) in M62TU versions, and is driven by a chain. The successor to the M62 is the BMW N62.\n\nIn 1998, the high-performance S62 engine was introduced, specifically for the E39 M5 and other models. This 90° V8 engine has a displacement of 4.9 L, with an aluminum construction and a DOHC valvetrain that includes VVT. It produces power outputs ranging from 394 to 625 hp and torque between 369 to 443 lb-ft. The S62 engine was produced until 2003 and is succeeded by the BMW S65.",
