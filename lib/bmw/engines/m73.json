  "summary": "The BMW M73 engine, produced from 1993 to 2002, features an updated roller-rocker valve-train with a displacement of 5.4 L, achieved through a 1 mm increase in cylinder bore (to 85 mm) and a 4 mm increase in piston stroke (to 79 mm). Unlike most BMW engines of the time that adopted dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder, the M73 utilizes a single overhead camshaft with two valves per cylinder. A prototype four-valve engine, the M72, was developed but not produced due to comfort issues. The M73 succeeded the M70 engine and was later replaced by the BMW N73.",
