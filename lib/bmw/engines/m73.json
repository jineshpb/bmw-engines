  "notes": "The M73 engine, an upgrade from the M70, features an updated roller-rocker valve train with increased displacement, achieving an 85mm bore and a 79mm stroke. Unlike other BMW engines that transitioned to dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder, the M73 retains a single overhead camshaft with two valves per cylinder. BMW also developed a prototype four-valve V12 engine, the M72, which produced 265 kW and 530 N⋅m of torque, but it did not meet the comfort standards required for large sedans and was not produced."
