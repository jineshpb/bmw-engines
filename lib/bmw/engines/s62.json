  "notes": "The BMW S62 engine, designated as S62B50, is a high-performance V8 variant of the M62 and is used in the E39 M5 and E52 Z8 models. It was notable for being BMW's first V8 engine equipped with double-VANOS, allowing for variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. The engine delivers 294 kW (400 PS; 394 hp) at 6600 rpm and a torque of 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft) at 3800 rpm, with a redline of 7000 rpm. It features a bore of 94 mm and a stroke of 89 mm, resulting in a displacement of 4,941 cc (301.5 cu in), which is larger than the 4,398 cc displacement of the largest M62 engine available at that time."
