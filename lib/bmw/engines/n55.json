  "summary": "The BMW N55 is a turbocharged straight-six petrol engine produced from 2009 to 2021, replacing the N54 engine. It was the first BMW straight-six to feature a twin-scroll turbocharger and won three consecutive Ward's 10 Best Engines awards from 2011 to 2013. The engine has a displacement of 3.0 liters, with an aluminum cylinder block and head, and a compression ratio of 10.2:1. It produces a maximum engine speed of 7,000 RPM. The N55 was eventually phased out following the introduction of the BMW B58 engine in 2015.",
