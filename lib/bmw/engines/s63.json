  "notes": "The S68 engine features an 88.3 mm stroke and maintains the same displacement as its predecessor, with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. It utilizes a hot-vee design with one turbocharger per cylinder bank, enhancing turbocharger pressure through a unique cross-pattern exhaust manifold that alters the exhaust sound to resemble a 180-degree V8 configuration. The engine includes an external oil cooler and a newly developed oil pump. It operates as a 48-volt mild hybrid, incorporating a 9 kW electric motor with 200 N⋅m of torque, installed within the transmission for improved performance. The 48-volt battery has a capacity of 20 Ah, while the system requires a larger 90 Ah battery. The variable camshaft control (VANOS) is now electrically operated. The S68 meets the Euro 6d emissions standard and is expected to comply with the stricter Euro 7 standard set for 2025. The engine can reach a maximum speed of 7200 rpm."
