  "notes": "The N62 engine is a completely new design, distinct from the M60 and M62 engines. It has a 4.4L displacement, featuring a bore of 92 mm and a stroke of 82.7 mm. Key features include double-VANOS variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust camshafts, double overhead camshafts (DOHC) with four valves per cylinder, and an aluminum engine block and cylinder head. The N62 is notable for being the first BMW V8 to incorporate Valvetronic technology, which allows for variable valve lift ranging from 0.03mm to 9.85mm, improving efficiency by adjusting lift instead of relying on the throttle body during regular operation. The engine has a redline of 6500 rpm and includes a throttle body for emergency situations and specific conditions like cold starts. Additionally, it uses a vacuum pump for the brake booster and certain auxiliary systems, linking it to proper engine functioning and emissions control."
