  "notes": "The S68 engine features a stroke of 88.3 mm and maintains the same displacement as its predecessor, with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. It utilizes a hot-vee design with one turbocharger per cylinder bank, enhancing turbocharger pressure through a unique cross-pattern exhaust manifold. This design alters the engine sound to resemble that of a 180-degree V8 configuration. The engine is cooled by an external oil cooler and incorporates a newly developed oil pump. It operates as a 48-volt mild hybrid system, equipped with a 9 kW electric motor that provides 200 N⋅m of torque, aiding in hot starts while a standard 12-volt starter manages cold starts. The engine meets the Euro 6d emissions standard and is expected to comply with the upcoming Euro 7 standard. The variable camshaft control (VANOS) has transitioned to an electrical system. The combustion engine can reach a maximum speed of 7200 rpm.",
