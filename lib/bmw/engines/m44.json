  "summary": "The BMW M44 engine, produced from 1996 to 2000, features several upgrades over its predecessor, the M42. Key enhancements include roller rocker arms, a hot-wire mass air flow sensor, and an increased displacement from 1.8 L to 1.9 L. It also has a grey cast iron crankshaft, a dual length intake manifold for improved performance, and a significant reduction in valve train friction, leading to quieter operation and better fuel efficiency. While peak power remains the same as the M42, mid-range power and peak torque are notably improved.",
