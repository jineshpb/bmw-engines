  "summary": "The BMW N54 engine, produced from 2006 to 2016, is a straight-six, 3.0 L (2,979 cc) twin-turbo petrol engine. It has received six consecutive International Engine of the Year awards and three Ward's 10 Best Engines awards. The N54 was phased out with the introduction of its successor, the N55, in 2009, and the last model using the N54 was the E89 Z4 roadster. A high-output version of the N54 is featured in the 1 Series M Coupe, Z4 35iS, and 335iS, but there is no M version of the N54.",
