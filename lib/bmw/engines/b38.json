It is part of a modular engine family that includes straight-four and straight-six configurations. The B38 features a displacement of 400 cc per cylinder for the 1.2 L version and 500 cc for the 1.5 L version, sharing many components with the BMW B37 engine. This engine is utilized in both front-wheel and rear-wheel drive applications, including the Mini Hatch and BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, and was first used in the BMW i8 hybrid sports coupé as a transverse mid-mounted engine. Key specifications include a DOHC valvetrain, a compression ratio of 11:1, and direct fuel injection.",
