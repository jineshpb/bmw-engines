The S54 was marketed as the high performance equivalent to the M54, however it
is actually more an evolution of the BMW S50 and shares few parts with the
M54.[11] As per the S50, the engine block is made of cast iron, unlike the
aluminium engine block used by the M54.[12] Redline is 8,000Â rpm.Compared with
the S50, the S54 features:[11][13][14]There is no direct successor to the S54,
since the following generation E90/E92/E93 M3 was powered by the V8 BMW S65
engine.Variations in power and torque outputs are often due to country-specific
emissions regulations, or space constraints of a chassis affecting the layout of
the intake/exhaust system.An upgraded version of the S54 engine was used in the
E46 M3 CSL. This engine is designated S54B32HP and the changes include a revised
intake made from carbon fiber, revised camshafts, a MAP sensor (instead of the
MAF sensor used in the regular S54),[3] a lightweight exhaust manifold with a
straighter air path (which later became standard on the regular S54) and a
straightened intake manifold.[18]
